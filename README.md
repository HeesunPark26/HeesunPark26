ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Heesun Park. 

I used to study human decision-making using computational modeling and neuroimaging techniques. 
Now I'm working as a data scientist at Wellysis. 

- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in applying statistics and machine learning to healthcare services.

- I usually use Python, R, and SQL for data extraction, preprocessing, manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

- Are you interested in my repos?
  - [project_WMDM_public](https://github.com/CCS-Lab/project_WMDM_public): analysis code and data for my first-author manuscript. "The neurocognitive role of working memory load when Pavlovian motivational control affects instrumental learning". You can find R codes for data analysis and cognitive modeling, and related modeling codes. [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.01.502269)
  - [API-study_2023](https://github.com/HeesunPark26/API-study_2023) & [API-study_2022](https://github.com/HeesunPark26/API-study_2022): API study (Wellysis in-house study) repositories. API-study_2022 was the first study, and API-study_2023 was the second study. Some details (authentication, functions related to user) are omitted in the first study, but full details are being implemented in the second study.
  - [Meta-d_STAN](https://github.com/HeesunPark26/Meta-d_STAN): the Stan codes of Meta-d' model. I implemented the meta-d' model using Stan, referring the paper and model code implemented in different modeling language. For the detail, check the repo!
